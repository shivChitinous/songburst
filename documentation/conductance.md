# Functions to Process Conductance Model Data

1. `sptr_con`: extracts spike train from voltage trace given dataframe `VI`, vector `v` containing column numbers specific to voltage readings and vector `i` containing column numbers specific to current readings

2. `hvc_neuron`: extracts and plots data from _Ross et al. (2017)_ conductance model of HVC from the `.csv` files in the directory
